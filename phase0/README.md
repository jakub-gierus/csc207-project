## Running Phase0 Login

- Run the Main.java class. 
- There are some default Admin and Basic users (Check `storage/adminUsers.csv` and `storage/basicUsers.csv` for login info)
- **Note: The program will require that `phase0` is the running project. If project is a different directory, then line 22 and 30 in `CLIControllerPresenter.java` will need to be modified accordingly.**
- After running the program and making changes to users (ban, new user, etc.) exiting the program as directed in the terminal will store the new events and users in according `.cvs` files, which will be available (in user history) when the program is next launched.
