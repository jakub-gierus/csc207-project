## Running Phase 2

- Run the Main.java class.
- There are some default Admin and Basic users (Check `storage/adminUsers.csv` and `storage/basicUsers.csv` for login info)
- **Note: The program will require that `phase1` is the running project. If project is a different directory, then config parameters in Main.java will need to be modified accordingly.**


## Things to Do in the Program
- In the main menu, you should first log in with (username: `admin`, password: `admin`)
  - This account has art pre-loaded for your review
  - You can traverse to the wallet called `admin's wallet` to explore the art within it
- Go back to main menu -> go to market -> put item on market -> choose  1 of the 2 arts preloaded into the account
- Log out of `admin` account, **Note: do NOT exit the program, just log out using the menu**
- Log in with (username: `superuser`, password: `admin123`)
- This account has money pre-loaded into the system to make a trade
- Traverse to the market -> trade -> select the item you put onto the market -> select `superuser's wallet` -> cash -> Success!
- Now if you go to `superuser's wallet`, your new art will be in your wallet, and the cash amount of the art will be deducted from your liquid balance
