New features added for phase 2:

- A language selector system, allowing the user to switch between English, Spanish, and Mandarin.
- An Art Appraiser system, which evaluates the value of a piece of art by comparing the trade value of its component
  characters to the rest of the art present in the system.
- A new database system, the application is now integrated with Amazon DynamoDB so that the data is now hosted on the
  cloud and accessible anywhere. As a result, new tools for data management is now available to developers.
- (Unfinished) An Android client for the application. Though it is not yet connected to the application backend the
  UI is trivially functional. Android files can be accessed via https://github.com/chait27/csc207 (If access isn't working,
  email chait.mahajan@mail.utoronto.ca)
- The phase 1 codebase has been refactored and cleaned.
